A proof-of-concept project for assessing various design-first API testing tools.

## Dredd

Dredd is a language-agnostic command-line tool for validating API description document against backend implementation of the API.

## swagger-test-templates

STT is a test code generation tool that can create data-driven API tests from a user-defined generator (located at `test/swagger-test-templates/generate.js`) and a swagger definition. It's usage here is as a self-contained means to create tests from a singular swagger definition using the supertest API and chai assertions.

## hippie-swagger

hippie-swagger is a tool for testing RESTful APIs. In addition to validating api behavior, it will fail tests when swagger documentation is missing or inaccurate.

# Start

To edit the swagger design, run `npm run start:edit`

To start the API, run `npm start`

To execute the dredd framework against the API, run `npm run test:dredd`

To generate tests from swagger using swagger-test-templates and supertest, run `npm run generate-tests`

To execute the supertest tests generated above using mocha, run `npm run test:stt`

To execute hippie-swagger tests (not autogenerated), run `npm run test:hippie`
